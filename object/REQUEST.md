# TODO
Just in case, if there's a specific function name that you're going to use, pretending it had been 
done, but you're not sure the specific detail of doing that, and you're sure it belong to this manager,
then write down the function and its job in the following list so when we're going to deal that, 
we can have a thought of the proper name/ we can priorotize it.

## Item data request (July 5th)
Up till this point, most fundamental definition of the items are 90% defined (not solid yet), 
although most of them are still on their way to become functional, it could be a good time 
for us to start the design of items. Here're some request for demo items for further debug:
**When you're building items, make sure you're NOT copying the scene, but right click and Create a new inheritance scene!**
- A basic item category tree, maybe include 5-10 categories
- Script-not-required items, spread out to each category (and yes, leave one of the categories blank, I'd like to see what bug that may cause)
