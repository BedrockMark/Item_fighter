# TODO
Just in case, if there's a specific function name that you're going to use, pretending it had been 
done, but you're not sure the specific detail of doing that, and you're sure it belong to this manager,
then write down the function and its job in the following list so when we're going to deal that, 
we can have a thought of the proper name/ we can priorotize it.
