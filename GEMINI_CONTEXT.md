# Gemini Session Context

This file contains a summary of the previous development session to help bootstrap the next one.

## Session Summary (2025-07-06)

During this session, we focused on implementing core gameplay mechanics related to items, buffs, and inventory management.

1.  **`item.gd` Overhaul**:
    *   The `Item` class was significantly enhanced to be a versatile base for most in-game objects.
    *   Implemented core functions for usage as a weapon (`attack`, `shoot_bullet`), a container (`add_item`), a plugin/attachment (`add_plugin`, `remove_plugin`), and a consumable (`use`).
    *   Functionality for being equipped and unequipped (`equipt`, `unequipt`) was added, linking the item to a `Mob`.

2.  **Robust Buff System Implementation**:
    *   **`buff.gd`**: Extended the `Buff` class to support non-numerical property overrides by adding the `effect_override` dictionary. This allows buffs to change things like textures, behaviors, or other non-stackable properties.
    *   **`mob.gd` & `item.gd`**: Implemented a robust buff handling system in both `Mob` and `Item` classes. This system correctly manages the application and removal of multiple, potentially conflicting, property-override buffs. It tracks the original values of properties and ensures they are correctly restored when buffs expire, preventing data corruption from out-of-order buff removal.

3.  **Hierarchical Inventory System**:
    *   **`inventory.gd`**: Completely refactored the `Inventory` class to support a hierarchical structure (containers within containers).
    *   Implemented a smart `input_item` function that recursively searches the entire inventory tree to find the "best" slot for an item based on user-defined priority rules (`priorityCategory`, `priorityProperty`) and capacity constraints.
    *   Established an automatic cleanup mechanism: when an item is added to an inventory, it connects its `tree_exiting` signal to the inventory's `remove_item` function, ensuring data integrity when items are destroyed.

## Getting Started for Next Session

To quickly get up to speed, please **read the following key files first**:

*   `class/buff.gd` - To understand how buffs are structured.
*   `class/inventory.gd` - To understand the complex hierarchical inventory logic.
*   `object/item/item.gd` - To see how items function and manage their own state/buffs.
*   `object/mob/mob.gd` - To see how characters handle buffs and equipment.
*   `class/item_category.gd` - For context on how items are categorized.

### Key Notes & Considerations

*   **Buff System is Critical**: The logic for `add_buff` and `remove_buff` in both `item.gd` and `mob.gd` is crucial and complex. It's designed to be robust against edge cases. Be careful when modifying it.
*   **Inventory is Hierarchical**: Remember that `inventory.gd` is designed for nested containers. The `input_item` logic is recursive.
*   **Ownership and Cleanup**: The system relies on `owner_inventory` properties and signal connections (`tree_exiting`) to keep the inventory state consistent. When creating or deleting items, ensure these connections are handled correctly.
